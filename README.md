# ArmyAnt.js
　　The javascript base utility library can be used for any scenario, whether in web page or node.js, or any other HTML5 apps.  
　　You can only require "libArmyAnt.js" to use it. If you include it without "require" (as add it to "script" tab), you will find it on the global variable "window"'s property "libArmyAnt"  
　　You can read any file and use it as:  

　　`var timer = new libArmyAnt.Scheduler();`

　　This library depends on the jquery library. In web pages, you must add jquery script before this file
